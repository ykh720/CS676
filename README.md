aspects of option pricing and hedging. Numerical methods for stochastic differential equations, strong
and weak convergence. Generating correlated random numbers. Time-stepping methods. Finite difference
methods for the Black-Scholes equation. Discretization, stability, convergence. Computational optimization,
portfolio optimization and model calibration, data driven optimization.

Epistemological status:

Asg3 Q1, Q2 (no code) has some minor errors, easily fixable. Can check the correct answer in marked assignments.

Asg3 Q5 has minor error which will affect the final output. It is fixed but not verified and tested. 

Asg4 Q6 has error regarding on how to use matlab linprog. Not fixed. 

Everything other than above are verified and tested and should be correct.
